The webroot folder (attached to the solution) contains a sample site.

Our server should be in the same folder and when we run it we open the browser, the address we will connect to using the browser will be: http://127.0.0.1:80 (where 80 is the port we will use).

Our server supports the following codes:
200 OK.
404 NOT FOUND.
302 MOVED TEMPORARILY.

(I did not write the sample site)
